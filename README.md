# Sorting Visualizer

This is a web app for visualizing a bunch of different sorting algorithms Like Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort.

## How it works

In this model, each element is represented by the height of the bar and the algorithms sort them placing the smallest elements on the left and the biggest elements on the right.

The algorithm moves the items around by swapping elements, without using any additional memory with creating another array.
